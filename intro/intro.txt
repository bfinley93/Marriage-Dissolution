To get the forms. Navigate to https://www.sjcourts.org Hover your mouse over Forms & Filing near the top of the 
website and click on Judicial Council Forms on the drop down menu that appears. Then, Select a Category and
scroll down to "Family Law - Dissolution, Legal Separation and Annulment FL-100 - 199, and press on 
"See Forms". Here, you'll find access to all of the forms you'll need.



To start the dissolution process there are three steps. Step one, file the initial paperwork
with the court. Step two, serve your spouse the dissolution papers. And finally, file the paperwork
with the court to tell them that your spouse was served.

Step one: FL-100, FL-110, FL-105, FL-150

Step two: FL-140, FL-142, copies of FL-100, FL-110, FL-105, FL-150, last two years of your most recent
tax returns. Last two pay stubs.

Step three: FL-115, FL-141

A lot of the forms will have areas that you leave blank if they do not pertain to your case.
If you don't understand a section of any of the forums or have any questions. Leave it blank and 
come into the pro-per office in the court and ask for help. Information that I put on the screen will either
be black or red. If the information is red, copy exactly what I'm putting on the form. If the information is 
black, write your own personal information in the area.
